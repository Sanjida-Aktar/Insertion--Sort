## 🚀 How Insertion Sort Works
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.  
It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort.

**Steps:**
1. Start from the second element.
2. Compare it with the elements before.
3. Insert it into the correct position.
4. Repeat until the array is sorted.

## 📊 Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n) (already sorted)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
